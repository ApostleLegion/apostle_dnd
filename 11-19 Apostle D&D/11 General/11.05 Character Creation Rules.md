# Character Creation
[Home](../11%20General/11.01%20Server%20Introduction.md)

Before getting too carried with creating your background, please consider the world's [Common Knowledge](https://discord.com/channels/1003087059247964161/1003087060544000037). This world takes place almost entirely underground; people have lived underground for a milennia. The Undersky is a myth of ancient legends.

## Approved Content
We will use officially released D&D 5e content only (No One D&D). No homebrew or third-party content is approved within the server (Tasha's class features and custom origins are allowed.) If any changes are made to accepted content, players may receive a Training Token to remake their character if they wish to do so.

If you have any questions, feel free to private message a DM or Admin or message in the [#questions](https://discord.com/channels/1003087059247964161/1003087060103594023) channel on the server.

## Disallowed Features/Items
### Feats
- Mystic Conflux
- Spelldriver (both from CR Books.)

### Backgrounds 
- All backgrounds from Spelljammer

## New Character Creation
A character will start at level 2 upon creation.

### Stats & Health
Stats will be the standard array with D&D. Those being 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15. These will be allotted to your character's principal ability scores, and modifiers will be added after these are placed. Character health is the average amount per level.

*Hint: In DnDbeyond use set health not rolled.*

### Starting Gear and Wealth
- All characters start with 250 gold which players can use to buy their equipment. 
- They also begin with one minor health potion. 
- In this server we do not use encumbrance or coin weight.

### Completed Character
Once you finish making your character send a direct message to one of the Admins in the Apostle server, and they will help set up everything else for you. 

If you have questions, ask them as well, and they will gladly help you. 

Please have equipment costs written out so the Admins can give you the correct amount of currency within the server.

Thank you!

# Character Advancement
We will not use standard D&D 5e XP charts. Instead, we will be using the below table to level up.

This table outlines the necessary Experience Points needed to level up to that level as well as any other things needed to advance. All XP will be tracked in the [#xp-logs](https://discord.com/channels/1003087059247964161/1003087060313325669) channel on the Apostle Server.

# Character Death
If the character dies, a new one may be created at the same level, but the experience count will lowered to the lowest amount that the current level requires. Ping a DM or Admin when doing so.

Resources and materials gained by the late character (the one who died) will be deleted upon the character's death.
