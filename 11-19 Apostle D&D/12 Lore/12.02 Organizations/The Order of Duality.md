# The Order of Duality
[Organizations](Organizations%20Overview.md)

When the world was first destroyed and civilization was forced underground, a group of kind-hearted religious individuals came together to help those less fortunate than themselves. But they quickly discovered that the desperate would do anything to get what they needed, including kidnapping those who could help and forcing them to help, pushing them to the brink of exhaustion or even death. So they found a sect of their faith to defend them, bringing about the birth of the **Order of Duality**.

**The Order** is split into 2 spheres of influence. Those who believe in the tenets of **Zeltris** and those who believe in the tenets of **Avione**.

### Symbol of the Order
The Order is shown by a combined falcon and serpent combined and seemingly in combat.

## Zeltris
Zeltris is the goddess of life, love, and passion. She is the patron of any and all healers, entertainers, and caretakers. She is also the goddess of anger, the elements, and violence. She is the patron of any and all torturers, warriors, and elementalists. She is chaotic, always seeking for change to happen, whether good or bad. Without her twin, she would scorch the world anew, even below ground.

### Symbol of Zeltris
Those within the Order reveal which side they have chosen to follow by wearing the symbol of either Zeltris or Avione. Zeltris is shown as a black serpent dancing within a fire.

## Avione
Avione is the god of slavery, death, and control. He is the patron of any and all slavers, jailers, and masters. He is also the god of peace, relief, and stillness. He is the patron of any and all guards, protectors, and law enforcement. He is peace and stillness, wanting to keep things as they are and have been, whether for the safety or detriment of those who are affected. Without his twin, he would freeze the world to ensure nothing ever changes.

### Symbol of Avione
Those within the Order reveal which side they have chosen to follow by wearing the symbol of either Zeltris or Avione. Avione is shown as a white falcon diving into frozen ground.
