# Downtime Overview
[Home](../11%20General/11.01%20Server%20Introduction.md)

Except for crafting items, we use the downtime rules written in [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#DowntimeActivities) for all downtime activities. Note the changes to costs and rewards of downtime activities as outlined in [Economy Changes](../15%20System%20Mechanics/15.05%20Economy%20Changes.md).

If you would like to do a downtime activity, create a post in [#Official Downtime Request](https://discord.com/channels/1003087059247964161/1045938342396706857) (this is a thread in [#downtime-info](https://discord.com/channels/1003087059247964161/1044654397013114930)) and include what kind of activity you want to do. You can use the following format:
```md
**Name of Character:** CharacterName
**Requested Activity:** Crime (vs DC 10)
**Requested DM:** Any, even a trial DM
**Place for RP:** Station Square
```

A DM needs to be present to supervise these activities and their associated skill challenges. The DM will roll to determine if there are any complications, where applicable, as well as gift you any funds earned. 

**Each player may complete a maximum of 2 downtime activities per day in real life.**
