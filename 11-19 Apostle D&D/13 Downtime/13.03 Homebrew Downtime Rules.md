 # Downtime Rules
[Downtime Overview](13.01%20Downtime%20Overview.md)

 We use a modified version of [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s downtime. 
 
 ## Modifications
 Activities that are changed will be noted below.
 - In our system all rewards and prices are halfed. 
 - The major change from the downtime of Zanathar's to Apostle's downtime is the Carousing activity. 
 - We have also created the bounty hunting activity and travel activity that will be outlined below.

## Carousing Downtime Changes:

### Contact Favors
All successful Carousing downtimes done will give Favors to players. These Favors can be used to double or even triple rewards for their specified activity at the cost of “using” them. In addition these Favors can bail a player out of a unfortunate situation in downtime activities. Only one Favor may be used on a downtime activity.

If a player wishes to use a Favor on a downtime please specify “Favor Used” in the activity portion of the request. 

Players that have gained Favors so far will get a message in their player channels about how many and from whom they received their Favor from. After this message please keep track of your own Favor. DMs will also keep track but having two records is better than one. 

### Special Carousing Roll Scenarios
- If on the Carousing Activity and the character rolls above a 21+ on the check:
  - please roll a `d100` and anything above a 75 makes one of the three Favors gained, a 3x Favor instead of a 2x
- If a player rolls a natural 20 the DM can either:
  - give them one 3x Favor plus the other two 2x Favors or 
  - give them an "in" to something for later development. 
  
  All Carousing must be noted in [#carousing-channel](https://discord.com/channels/1003109601035690064/1048723906510463008) in the Staff Server.

## Petty Crime
Petty Crime is different than [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s crime in [economic differences](../15%20System%20Mechanics/15.05%20Economy%20Changes.md) and rolls. To engage in petty crime, the rolls required to succeed change from `Stealth, Tools and one of [Deception, Investigation, or Perception]` to **Stealth, Sleight of Hand and one of [Deception, Investigation, Persuasion, or Perception]**. This is to signify the change from heists to petty crimes and stealing.

## Bounty Hunting
This Downtime option takes a player through a series of checks to try to capture and or kill (depending on the request) a creature or humanoid. A player will be asked to roll at least one of each of these checks during this downtime. [Survival or Nature], [Perception or Investigation], [Stealth or Performance], and [Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation]. 

- On four successes, the target doesn’t struggle and goes willingly
- With three successes, the target gives a little fight (half hp for stat blocks)
- With two successes, the target fights with all its strength
- With one success, the target evades capture
- With zero success, the target is not found at all

These rolls may be made out of role-play or in role-play as events unfold. If all of the first three rolls fail, the last is not needed, as the target was never found. There will be five categories of Bounties that may be upgraded with NPCs. 

These five are as follows:

Tier | DC | Challenge Rating | Rewards
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
S | DC 18 + Character Level | CR creature above normal level | 125 x Character Level gp
A | DC 15 + Character Level | CR creature normal level | 50 x Character Level gp
B | DC 12 + Character Level | CR creature normal level | 25 x Character Level gp
C | DC 10 + Character Level | CR creature below normal level | 12 x Character Level gp
D | DC 8 + Character Level | CR creature below normal level | 5 x Character Level gp

Bounty Hunting has the complication rate of when two fails happen there is a 10% chance to have a complication. For three fails, there is a 10% chance of complication. If all fails, there is a 50% chance of complications. Complications are up to the DM running the bounty hunt.

## Researching Blueprints
You can research magical item recipe using **Lore** gained from the [Official Research Downtime Activity](13.02%20Published%20Downtime%20Rules.md#research). The following table demonstrates how much **Lore** is required to finish researching a particular recipe. You can only research recipes up to a rarity that is dependent upon your tier.

Tier | Item Rarity | Lore Required
:--: | :--: | :--:
1 | Uncommon | 3
2 | Rare | 6
3 | Very Rare | 9
4 | Legendary | 12
