 # Downtime Rules
[Downtime Overview](13.01%20Downtime%20Overview.md)

 We use a modified version of [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s downtime. 
 
 ## Modifications
 Activities that are changed will be noted below.
 - In our system all rewards and prices are halfed. 
 - The major change from the downtime of Zanathar's to Apostle's downtime is the Carousing activity. 
 - We have also created the bounty hunting activity and travel activity that will be outlined below.

## Carousing Downtime Changes:

### Contact Favors
All successful Carousing downtimes done will give Favors to players. These Favors can be used to double or even triple rewards for their specified activity at the cost of “using” them. In addition these Favors can bail a player out of a unfortunate situation in downtime activities. Only one Favor may be used on a downtime activity.

If a player wishes to use a Favor on a downtime please specify “Favor Used” in the activity portion of the request. 

Players that have gained Favors so far will get a message in their player channels about how many and from whom they received their Favor from. After this message please keep track of your own Favor. DMs will also keep track but having two records is better than one. 

### Special Carousing Roll Scenarios
- If on the Carousing Activity and the character rolls above a 21+ on the check:
  - please roll a `d100` and anything above a 75 makes one of the three Favors gained, a 3x Favor instead of a 2x
- If a player rolls a natural 20 the DM can either:
  - give them one 3x Favor plus the other two 2x Favors or 
  - give them an "in" to something for later development. 
  
  All Carousing must be noted in [#carousing-channel](https://discord.com/channels/1003109601035690064/1048723906510463008) in the Staff Server.

## Petty Crime
Petty Crime is different than [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s crime in [economic differences](../15%20System%20Mechanics/15.05%20Economy%20Changes.md) and rolls. To engage in petty crime, the rolls required to succeed change from `Stealth, Tools and one of [Deception, Investigation, or Perception]` to **Stealth, Sleight of Hand and one of [Deception, Investigation, Persuasion, or Perception]**. This is to signify the change from heists to petty crimes and stealing.

## Bounty Hunting
This Downtime option takes a player through a series of checks to try to capture and or kill (depending on the request) a creature or humanoid. A player will be asked to roll at least one of each of these checks during this downtime. `[Survival or Nature], [Perception or Investigation], [Stealth or Performance], and [Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation]`. 

- On four successes, the target doesn’t struggle and goes willingly
- With three successes, the target gives a little fight (half hp for stat blocks)
- With two successes, the target fights with all its strength
- With one success, the target evades capture
- With zero success, the target is not found at all

These rolls may be made out of role-play or in role-play as events unfold. If all of the first three rolls fail, the last is not needed, as the target was never found. There will be five categories of Bounties that may be upgraded with NPCs. 

These five are as follows:

Tier | DC | Challenge Rating | Rewards
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
S | DC 18 + Proficiency Modifier | CR creature above normal level | 125 x Character Level gp
A | DC 15 + Proficiency Modifier | CR creature normal level | 50 x Character Level gp
B | DC 12 + Proficiency Modifier | CR creature normal level | 25 x Character Level gp
C | DC 10 + Proficiency Modifier | CR creature below normal level | 12 x Character Level gp
D | DC 8 + Proficiency Modifier | CR creature below normal level | 5 x Character Level gp

Bounty Hunting has the complication rate of: 
- If two fails happen there is a 10% chance to have a complication. 
- For three fails, there is a 10% chance of complication. 
- If all fail, there is a 50% chance of complications. 

Complications are up to the DM running the bounty hunt.

## Training
To train a player must have Caroused to gain a teacher to be trained by. This teacher is specific to the type of training that is done with them, meaning if a player wishes to train a different thing they must find a new trainer. All things in Xanathar's are still able to be trained in addition to that players may now train **half ASIs** (Ability Score Increases). These half ASIs are governed by these rules:

- A player can only have trained an ability score to the maximum score of 18 (+4)
- A player only is allotted their proficiency modifier amount of times they may train to increase ability scores
- A player can not switch these half ASI scores once they are set and may lose them if their character is killed or altered significantly.

## Research
Players may research magic items, at **level 1** a player may research up to an **uncommon** magic item per downtime. Once a player reaches **level 7** they may begin to research **rare** items. Once they reach **level 13** they may research **very rare** magic items, and finally once they reach **level 18** they may research **legendary** magic items. A player that researched a magic item in this way gains the recipe for said magic item and can share this recipe or keep it private if they wish to.

## Researching Blueprints
You can research magical item recipes using **Lore** gained from the [Official Research Downtime Activity](13.02%20Published%20Downtime%20Rules.md#research). The following table demonstrates how much **Lore** is required to finish researching a particular recipe. You can only research recipes up to a rarity that is dependent upon your level.

Minimum Character Level | Item Rarity | Lore Required
:--: | :--: | :--:
1 | Uncommon | 3
7 | Rare | 6
13 | Very Rare | 9
18 | Legendary | 12

## Travel
Travel is a free downtime action that can be taken as many times as a player wishes to travel. While traveling, a player will make these checks: `[Survival], [Perception], and [Stealth or Intimidation]`. 

- With three successes, the rate of complication drops to 0%.
- With only two successes, the rate of complication rises to 10%. 
- With one success, the complication rate rises to 25%.
- With zero success complication rate rises to 75%. 

The DC to pass raises as players level up by the tiers of play in the PHB. This will be as follows:

Teir (Level of player) | DC
:--: | :--:
Tier 1(levels 1-4) | DC 12
Tier 2(levels 5-10) | DC 14
Tier 3(levels 11-16) | DC 16
Tier 4(levels 17-20 | DC 18
 
Complications are up to the DM running the travel. Most usual complications are when an enemy attacks the player, but on an off chance, a DM can rule that the player finds something interesting. Do not make it a habit to have complications be “good” things, as the tunnels are supposed to be scary to travel alone through. If a group of players wishes to travel through the tunnels, take the average level and average out the rolls made.

## Crafting
Crafting is one of the many downtime actions that a player can take. We will use the downtime rules as mentioned in Xanathar’s, but there is a DC and necessary completion checks instead of work weeks. The cost for the item will be distributed between the downtime sessions necessary to complete the item, stated below. The DCs will be stated below as well as the necessary completed checks:

Rarity of Item | # of Completions Necessary | DC to Succeed | Gold Cost per Session
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
Common | DC 10 | One | 50 gold coins
Uncommon | DC 15 | Two | 100 gold coins
Rare | DC 20 | Four | 500 gold coins
Very Rare | DC 25 | Six | 3500 gold coins
Legendary | DC 30 | Eight | 12500 gold coins

Any session costs must be paid before the rolls are made to craft an item. If a player fails the check to make an item, they must pay half the gold of the downtime session of crafting for the item on top of the session cost. If they fail the check by ten or more, they must pay the downtime session cost again and lose the material necessary to make the item. 
The materials that are necessary for crafting are material shards. These shards come in different rarities, from uncommon to legendary. To craft an item, a player needs a number of shards of a rarity similar to the item they wish to craft as well as the recipe of the item they wish to craft. In addition to this, if the item in question is an enchantment to a pre-existing item, the item getting enchanted also needs to be aquired (I.E. a +1 longsword needs a longsword to enchant). A shard will be consumed if the downtime crafting session is successful or if the player **fails** by **ten** or more.

Crafting Mundane Items:
Crafting mundane items is a lot easier than crafting magical ones. A player that wishes to craft a mundane item can do so with the crafting downtime. If a player is not proficient in the tools necessary for crafting the item they pay full price in gold for the item and do not need to roll. If a player is profecient in the correct tools they may reduce the cost by 10% of its original value and craft it. If a player has expertise in the correct tools this discount rises to 25% of the total price. 

## Selling Treasure
A player that gains itmes from quests, like art pieces, gems, etc., can use this downtime to sell those items in bulk. A DM will ask for a persuasion check (or another check if applicable) to be rolled. If a player rolls a 12 or above they get an additional 10% of the total coin cost of the items being sold. If a player rolls between a 8-12 the player gets the normal amount of coin cost of the items. If a player rolls below an 8 they get a 10% deduction on the total price of the items being sold. On a 1 or a 20, natrually rolled, a player losses or gains 20% of the total price respectively.
