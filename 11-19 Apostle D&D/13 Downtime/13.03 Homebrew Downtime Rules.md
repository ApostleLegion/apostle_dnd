 # Downtime Rules
 We use a modified version of [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s downtime. 
 
 ## Modifications
 Activities that are changed will be noted below.
 - In our system all rewards and prices are dropped a coin value. (Gold -> Silver) 
 - The major change from the downtime of Zanathar's to Apostle's downtime is the Carousing activity. 
 - We have also created the bounty hunting activity and travel activity that will be outlined below.

## Carousing Downtime Changes:
*Note:* This section doesn't really talk about the changes of the Carousing Downtime but focuses more on the role of NPCs
The most major change is the use of NPCs to further other downtime activities. 

- Every NPC that was gained under a carousing subcategory (i.e. Crime, Working, etc.) can be used to double rewards for any activity other than Carousing. 
- NPCs can also bail characters out of bad situations but also "uses" that NPC. 

### Special Carousing Roll Scenarios
- If on the Carousing Activity and the character rolls above a 21+ on the check:
  - please roll a `d100` and anything above a 75 makes one of the three NPCs gained, a 3x NPC instead of a 2x
- If a player rolls a natural 20 the DM can either:
  - give them one 3x NPC plus the other two 2x NPCs or 
  - give them an "in" to something for later development. 
  
  All Carousing must be noted in [#carousing-channel](https://discord.com/channels/1003109601035690064/1048723906510463008) in the Staff Server.

## Petty Crime
Petty Crime is different than [Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s crime in [economic differences](../15%20System%20Mechanics/15.05%20Economy%20Changes.md) and rolls. To engage in petty crime, the rolls required to succeed change from `Stealth, Tools and one of [Deception, Investigation, or Perception]` to **Stealth, Sleight of Hand and one of [Deception, Investigation, Persuasion, or Perception]**. This is to signify the change from heists to petty crimes and stealing.

## Bounty Hunting
This Downtime option takes a player through a series of checks to try to capture and or kill (depending on the request) a creature or humanoid. A player will be asked to roll at least one of each of these checks during this downtime. [Survival or Nature], [Perception or Investigation], [Stealth or Performance], and [Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation]. 

- On four successes, the target doesnâ€™t struggle and goes willingly
- With three successes, the target gives a little fight (half hp for stat blocks)
- With two successes, the target fights with all its strength
- With one success, the target evades capture
- With zero success, the target is not found at all

These rolls may be made out of role-play or in role-play as events unfold. If all of the first three rolls fail, the last is not needed, as the target was never found. There will be five categories of Bounties that may be upgraded with NPCs. 

These five are as follows:

Tier | DC | Challenge Rating | Rewards
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
S | DC 25 | CR creature above normal level | 1,000 sp
A | DC 20 | CR creature normal level | 200 sp
B | DC 15 | CR creature normal level | 100 sp
C | DC 10 | CR creature below normal level | 50 sp
D | DC 10 | CR creature way below normal level | 25 sp

Bounty Hunting has the complication rate of when two fails happen there is a 10% chance to have a complication. For three fails, there is a 10% chance of complication. If all fails, there is a 50% chance of complications. Complications are up to the DM running the bounty hunt.
