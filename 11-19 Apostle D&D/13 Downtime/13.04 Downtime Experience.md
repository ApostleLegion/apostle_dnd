 # Downtime Experience
[Downtime Overview](13.01%20Downtime%20Overview.md)

Each downtime will award XP based on the role-play done for the activity chosen. A player may only get XP from a Downtime if it is role-played and not just rolled for. A player's maximum XP per downtime is three times their level. The DM running the downtime awards XP as they see fit up to the limited amount.
