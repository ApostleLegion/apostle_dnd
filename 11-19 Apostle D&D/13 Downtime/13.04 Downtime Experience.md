Downtime activities **only reward experience when it is roleplayed**, this is to help promote exploring, discovering, and fleshing out the world we've created. Experience will be awarded per downtime activity as follows:

Downtimes if roleplayed out give 4xp to the player for just doing the downtime.

You can run **two** downtime activities per week; if both activities are roleplayed, you can earn double what exists on the chart.
