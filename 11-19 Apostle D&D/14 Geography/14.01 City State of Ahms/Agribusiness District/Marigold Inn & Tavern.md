# Marigold Inn & Tavern
[Agribusiness District](Agribusiness%20District%20Overview.md)

The charming Inn and Tavern are where most traveling folks stay when they arrive in [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md). To cover the stench of booze, the tavern has thousands of Marigolds spread across its infrastructure. A sweet elder woman Elf can be found behind the bar

## Upstairs
Stepping upstairs to the rooms of the Marigold Inn, a long hallway that ends in a beautiful tapestry marigold flower. Along this hallway are wall-mounted candles with glass bulbs surrounding them. There are many rooms to choose from, and a cozy atmosphere takes hold once inside. A wooden framed bed is big enough for two, and a wooden dresser with a mirror adorns the entrance room. Attached to this room is a small bath and restroom with another marigold tapestry covering a window above the toilet. Overall the rooms are beautiful but not overly fancy.
