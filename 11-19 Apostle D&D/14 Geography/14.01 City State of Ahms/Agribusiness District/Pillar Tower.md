# Pillar Tower
[Agribusiness District](Agribusiness%20District%20Overview.md)

One of the most notable structures in all of Ahms is the Pillar Tower. It is, quite literally, an architectural wonder. It stretches the entire height-span of the cavern that engulfs the city; a perfect rectangular prism from ground to cavern ceiling. Glass windows are plainly visible outside the structure, signifying the different interior levels. While the building is as tall as it could possibly be, it's only about eighty feet on either side. This is often where the authoritative figures of Ahms gather. Additionally, there are some floors dedicated to the research and study of magic, while some civil departments have a claim on space within.
