# Ahms South Road
[Agribusiness District](Agribusiness%20District%20Overview.md)

## Alley Maze
The back alleys of the south side of the [Agribusiness District](Agribusiness%20District%20Overview.md) are riddled with little petty criminals and some more career criminals. These alleyways are home to the downtrodden but also the weary travelers. These alley ways are easy to get lost in and hard to find a way out once inside. Enter at your own risk.

## Barley Guard Post
The small bastion of lawfulness on the South Main Road houses a couple of guards and a small jail. The buildings front looks like a castle tower and a large door set into the stone and brick. Otherwise the front looks like just a tower.
