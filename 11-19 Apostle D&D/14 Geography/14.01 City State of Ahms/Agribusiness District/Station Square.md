# Ahms Station Square
[Agribusiness District](Agribusiness%20District%20Overview.md)

A beautiful cacophony of metal support beams and brick make what is called The Station. It’s metal supports arc into archways that all lead to a center point where a brick pentagon building has glass windows at the base floor. Clerks sit and take ticket or gold for travel as long lines of people stand in front of them. The Station is busy at all times, having carriage convoys entering in and out of the different archways. It’s chaos but controlled and beautiful chaos.
