# Broken Brick Tavern
[Cobblebrick Quarters](Cobblebrick%20Quarters%20Overview.md)

The Broken Brick got its name from taking the leftover, broken bricks that the wealthy of Ahms didn't want and creating the small tavern in the depths of the Cobblebrick Quarter. Far enough into the 'city' that the guards don't come to very often and the people are able to speak freely.
