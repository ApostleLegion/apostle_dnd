# The Cobblebrick Quarters
[Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md)

Tucked away in the back of the City of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md), the Cobblebrick Quarters can be found. A large cobble stone wall stands between Cobblebrick and the rest of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md). Behind the heavily guarded wall, behind the dark and cold walls the city awaits.

In lower [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md), the workers of the farmers can be found. They are the lowest income in the city, and can be found in the housing district of the city. The people here are tired, pale, and cold hearted
