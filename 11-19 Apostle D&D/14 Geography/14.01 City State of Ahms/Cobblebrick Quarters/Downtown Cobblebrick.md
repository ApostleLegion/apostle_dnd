# Downtown Cobblebrick
[Cobblebrick Quarters](Cobblebrick%20Quarters%20Overview.md)

A quick glance around the city square, or rather roundabout, shows a number of store fronts and alley ways. Guards tend to patrol this area plenty, though that usually doesn't stop thieves and the like to still try and make their own scores.
