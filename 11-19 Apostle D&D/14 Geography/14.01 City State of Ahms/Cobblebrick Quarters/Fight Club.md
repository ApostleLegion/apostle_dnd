[Cobblebrick Quarters](Cobblebrick%20Quarters%20Overview.md)

Hidden underneath the [Cobblebrick Quarters](Cobblebrick%20Quarters%20Overview.md) is a sizable cave with tunnels linking it to a few of the ramshackle houses as well as the tavern. Those who know about this place only share its existence to trustworthy or bloodthirsty people because this place is used for one thing: fights. What could be better cheap entertainment than watching people beat each other to a pulp and betting hard-earned, meager wages on them? 

If anyone asks where those new bruises are from, they're not from fighting in here. What the bosses don't know, they don't have to know.
