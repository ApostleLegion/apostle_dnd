# Warhouse Haven
[Cobblebrick Quarters](Cobblebrick%20Quarters%20Overview.md)

When the Farmers and Ranchers need more space than their barns allow, or when goods from the other Free Cities needs to sit and wait, here is where they go. The Warehouse Haven is a large expanse of warehouses strictly there to be used as extra space. After a recent liberation of many of the missing persons capable of healing here, the Order has begun to put their own rotations of Hunters and Gazers to keep an eye here in case there is another place to be found here.
