# Ahms North Entrance
[Farmstead District](Farmstead%20District%20Overview.md)

As travelers reach the end of the tunnel, they are welcomed by a blinding light from the opening ahead of them. Once your eyes adjust. You can see a dozen guards standing at the entrance to [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md). Armed with glistening silver swords that match the rest of their armor, they look intimidating for guards at the entrance. Each of the guards are assigned to a booth where the rest of the travelers get funneled into based on their appearance.
