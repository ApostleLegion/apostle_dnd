# Red River Grange
[Farmstead District](Farmstead%20District%20Overview.md)

Formed alongside a river of red water from the excess good soil that sits within it, the ranch produces a majority, if not all if the rumors are to be believed of the meat that the free cities have access to. Owned by the Denton Family, it is currently run by the youngest son, Elgar. Many of the jobs as ranch hands are paid by this man. With a reputation as a hard and shrewd man, many of his workers say good things of the half-elf and his family.
