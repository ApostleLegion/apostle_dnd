# The Ivy Water Wheel
[Farmstead District](Farmstead%20District%20Overview.md)

As one of the first structures created in [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md), the Ivy Water Wheel got its name from the beautiful Ivy that grows along the cobblestone walls of the house attached to the water wheel. Although no longer needed, it is still active from the small stream and has been transformed into a quaint tavern in the outreaches of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md).
