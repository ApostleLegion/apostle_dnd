# The Farside District
[Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md)

Past the farms and lights the cavern continues into dead grassy hills and stones. The Farside of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md) is the outskirts of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md) away from the main tunnels leading North and South. This is where the unruly folk of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md) go to do not so legal things if necessary.
