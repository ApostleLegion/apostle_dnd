# Village Half Nescros
[The Farside District](The%20Farside%20District%20Overview.md)

Near the line that marks the very little green grass and the fading of light a village of about 10 houses sits between this line. One half is decently well built and unkept while the other side in the darkness is unkept and almost in ruin.
