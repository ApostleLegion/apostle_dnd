# Ascendant Pond
[The Holy Grove](The%20Holy%20Grove%20Overview.md)

Behind the [Upper](Upper%20Holy%20Grove.md) and [Lower](Lower%20Holy%20Grove.md) portions of the [Grove](The%20Holy%20Grove%20Overview.md), the Ascendant Pond is tucked back towards the city walls. With beautiful willows that hang over the pond, and flowers sprouting around the bank, the Ascendant Pond is an incredible place to take a nap, go for a warm swim, or find seclusion from the busy City.
