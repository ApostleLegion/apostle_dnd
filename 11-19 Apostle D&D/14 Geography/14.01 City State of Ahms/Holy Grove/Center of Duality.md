# Center of Duality
[The Holy Grove](The%20Holy%20Grove%20Overview.md)

In the entirety of the city of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md), here is the main headquarters for the [Order of Duality](../../../12%20Lore/12.02%20Organizations/The%20Order%20of%20Duality.md). Made of clean white limestone with black basalt pillars, the compound is surrounded by a tall white wall of stone. Within are the sleeping quarters for any and all Order members. Here is where any and all requests for a healer is made and processed. Every report of a mission done while in [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md) is kept here and is free for any member of the public to come and read through. 

For the general public, the Center opens on the 2nd bell and closes on the 5th bell. (8 am to 8 pm)

## The Archives
Beneath the Center of Duality itself, a large library sits open to the public. Holding a vast majority of the information found in [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md), this is where the reports that any and all members of the Order have written find themselves.

## Hospital
On the ground floor of the Center, the hospital can be found near the middle of the Parthenon on the right side. Here, all sorts of intensive healing can be found. Resurrections, magical healing, mundane healing, and even healing of the mind and soul are found within the portion of the structure.
