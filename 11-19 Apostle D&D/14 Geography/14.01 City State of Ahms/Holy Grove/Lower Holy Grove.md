# Lower Holy Grove
[The Holy Grove](The%20Holy%20Grove%20Overview.md)

Down a slight hill from the [Upper Holy Grove](Upper%20Holy%20Grove.md), the Lower Holy Grove is more barren. With more wild flowers and grasses, its easy to see why the people of [Ahms](../Ahms%20Overview.md) come here to have a picnic.
