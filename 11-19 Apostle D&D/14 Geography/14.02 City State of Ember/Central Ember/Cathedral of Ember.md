# Cathedral of Ember
[Central Ember](./Central%20Ember%20Overview.md)

The second largest structure within [Central Ember](Central%20Ember%20Overview.md) looms over the many buildings nearby. Itâ€™s gothic architecture stands out as a testament to how old this city truly is. The etching and stone carvings within its walls depict the construction of this city by the dwarves many many years prior. The gods of [Ember](../Ember%20Overview.md) are almost unknown and this city has retrofitted the cathedral as a library and history collection site at the behest of the [Mintras Family]().
