# Firestone Cemetery
[Fire Stone District](Fire%20Stone%20District%20Overview.md)

A small cemetery can be found on the outskirts of the Old Firestone District. With dozens of small gravestones carved into the floor, it was created to commemorate those who died in a great battle. It deteriorated with no one to take care of the graveyard and very few visitors. It is desolate, with many broken stones, rusted metal, and unkept land.
