# Frieborn Manor
[Fire Stone District](Fire%20Stone%20District%20Overview.md)

Frieborn Manor is placed in the center of the [Fire Stone District](Fire%20Stone%20District%20Overview.md). Itâ€™s many arches and smoke columns make up a majority of the smog that comes from this district as it is the home to the fire giants of the city. This structure is massive and chaotic with many buildings and walk ways crossing over one another, it might just very well be a labyrinth of some kind.
