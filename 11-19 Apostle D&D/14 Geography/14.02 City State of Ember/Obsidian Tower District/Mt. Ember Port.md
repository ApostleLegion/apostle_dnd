# Mt. Ember Port
[Obsidian Tower District](Obsidian%20Tower%20District%20Overview.md)

The last bastion of civilization on the Isle of the Mount. This port is only used by military officials and the adventurous death wishers. The high walls around the commons of the port keep out what the Isle has for the denizens that wish to explore or rebuild what was once there.
