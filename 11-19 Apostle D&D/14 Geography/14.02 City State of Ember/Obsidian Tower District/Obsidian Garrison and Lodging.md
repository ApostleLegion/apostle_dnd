# Obsidian Garrison and Lodging
[Obsidian Tower District](Obsidian%20Tower%20District%20Overview.md)

About half way up this Isle of Obsidian two large builds stand out. The garrison and lodging houses for the military that patrols the thousand mile mines. These buildings are by far the most grand in the district, but they are still worn down and simple styled buildings.
