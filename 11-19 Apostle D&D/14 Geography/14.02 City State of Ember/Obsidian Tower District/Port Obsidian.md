# Port Obsidian
[Obsidian Tower District](Obsidian%20Tower%20District%20Overview.md)

The grand port on the souther side of the Isle of Obsidian as commoners of the district call it. This port is carved out of an obsidian cluster and the Magma Reavers slide into dock between the obsidian columns that rise around the port.
