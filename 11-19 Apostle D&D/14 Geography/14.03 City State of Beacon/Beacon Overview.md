The City State of Beacon is a machine powerhouse of the [Infernal Lands]().

Being a multi-story city, each level is its own district, and each district plays a significant role, making Beacon unique from the other city-states. With large machinery running through all four floors, the different levels of the city are assigned different tasks to upkeep the heart and soul of Beacon. The people differ significantly based on which district you find yourself in.

Beacon's four distinct districts starting at the top level, is the [Surge District](./Surge%20District/Surge%20District%20Overview.md), followed by the [Current District](./Current%20District/Current%20District%20Overview.md); next is the [Flickering District](./Flickering%20District/Flickering%20District%20Overview.md), and the bottom level of Beacon is called the [Cimmerian City](./Cimmerian%20City/Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md).
