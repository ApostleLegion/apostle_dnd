# The City State of Beacon
[The Infernal Lands](../Geography%20Overview.md)

The City State of Beacon is a machine powerhouse of the [The Infernal Lands](../Geography%20Overview.md).

Being a multi-story city, each level is its own district, and each district plays a significant role, making Beacon unique from the other city-states. With large machinery running through all four floors, the different levels of the city are assigned different tasks to upkeep the heart and soul of Beacon. The people differ significantly based on which district you find yourself in.

This city of knowledge and advancement has many layers to it, the top most being the cleanest and most wealthy. The lower in the city a person goes the more crime and grime begins to take place, until they have found themselves in [Cimmerian City](./Cimmerian%20City/Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md). The lowest levels of Beacon are havens for criminals and other unsavory folk to the city.

Beacon's four distinct districts starting at the top level, is the [Surge District](./Surge%20District/Surge%20District%20Overview.md), followed by the [Current District](./Current%20District/Current%20District%20Overview.md); next is the [Flickering District](./Flickering%20District/Flickering%20District%20Overview.md), and the bottom level of Beacon is called the [Cimmerian City](./Cimmerian%20City/Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md).
