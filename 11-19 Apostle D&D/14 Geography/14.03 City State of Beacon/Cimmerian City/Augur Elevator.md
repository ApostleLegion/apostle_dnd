# Augur Elevator
[Cimmerian City](Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md)

The base of the hollowed cylinder has what was a fine and smooth stone floor with dark metal inlays with the Sigil of the city of [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md) has long since been forgotten.

Six circular stone platforms hidden within cylinders of broken glass sit perfectly equidistant from each other around the [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md). Each stone platform has thick chains of polished metal, the only sign of life in the Undercity of [Cimmerian](Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md). Each platform is inlaid with the crest  of one of the 6 families that everyone knows rule the city.

While the elevators rarely land down in the Undercity, the hum of power from hidden machines beneath each of the 6 stone platforms is the only clue that the elevators are in near constant use. A stray crack of thunder from the lightning that fuels the elevators is the only sign that repairs must be made to one of the machines.

The [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md) is almost completely covered up with graffiti of different origins. What each one means is difficult to interpret for a citizen living in the undercity. Dried stains of blood also litter the [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md), though how long they've been there is anyone's guess.
