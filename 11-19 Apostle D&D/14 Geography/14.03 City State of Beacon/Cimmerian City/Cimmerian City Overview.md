# Cimmerian City
[Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md)

Cimmerian City is the Bottom layer of the City State of [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md). Almost entirely separate from the rest of [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md), it has been named a different city. The air is heavy at the Bottom of the technology-fueled city, and the people are suffering. Most are too poor to escape the gangs, rivalries, and corruption, and the people here are miserable.
