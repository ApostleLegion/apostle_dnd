# Shadow Valley
[Cimmerian City](Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md)

A metal door can be found in a dark alley of [Cimmerian City](Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md). Etched into the metal, the words "Shadow Valley" can be found right below a small window with a lock. If you know the right thing to say, welcome to the best-selling potions and poison shop in all the [Infernal Lands](). Beware of the people you'll meet inside, wouldn't want you to mix up your potion with poison.
