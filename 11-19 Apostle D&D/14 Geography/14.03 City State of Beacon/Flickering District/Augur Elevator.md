# Augur Elevator
[Flickering District](Flickering%20District%20Overview.md)

The Bronze Ring of this platform shines with the continues polish it receives from the people who walk by. An open expanse with a few seemingly random lines and squiggles, the bronze railway that keeps people from just falling down to the Undercity connects the 6 elevators. Each doorway to an elevator has the Crest of one of the 6 families of Beacon, and opens to a glass tube that holds a platform of beaten metal. However, only 4 of these doors open. 2 lead down to the Undercity, and is only used at the peril of whoever gets in. The other pair goes up to the Silver Ring.

It is a common enough thing for children to lean against the Bronze Ring and look down to the Undercity, while mothers try to encourage against the practice with horrid rumors and stories of what happens to naughty children who are sent down to the Undercity as punishment.
