# Flickering District
[Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md)

The Flickering District is the lower middle section of the City State of Beacon. Slightly nicer than [Cimmerian City](../Cimmerian%20City/Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md) but not nearly as exclusive as the [Current District](../Current%20District/Current%20District%20Overview.md), it is populated by the common folk. Those that spend their lives working on the machines and technology that fuels [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md).
