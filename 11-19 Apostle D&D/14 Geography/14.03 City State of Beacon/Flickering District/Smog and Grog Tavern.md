# Smog and Grog Tavern
[Flickering District](Flickering%20District%20Overview.md)

With pipes coming out of every corner of the tavern, the Smog and Grog Tavern was made from an out-of-date machine that pushed steam from [Cimmerian City](../Cimmerian%20City/Cimmerian%20City%20Overview.md) to the [Flickering District](Flickering%20District%20Overview.md). Being in the lower middle section of [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md), its Patrons are hard-working, tired, and ready to drink grog all hours of the day.
