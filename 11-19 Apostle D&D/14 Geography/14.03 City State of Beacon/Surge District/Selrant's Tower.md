# Selrant's Tower
[Surge District](Surge%20District%20Overview.md)

One of many mage towers throughout the Golden Ring of Beacon. This one sits on the outskirts of the Surge District and acts as a conduit for the electricity that circulates through the city. This five story tower of grey and black stones ends in blue tiled cone roof with a lightning rod and circulator attached to the top. Was temporarily overtaken by the arcane magics it tried to harness but adventurers from Ahms saved it, now it is home to Selrant and his many students.
