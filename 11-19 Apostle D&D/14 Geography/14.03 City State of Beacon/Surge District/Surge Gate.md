# Surge Gate
[Surge District](Surge%20District%20Overview.md)

A gate made of grey stones and metal stands in the way of the single entrance to Beacon. This wall is taller than most gates and blocks out the cityscape behind it. Standing at its entrance are a multitude of guards and a decently longer line of people trying to enter. Every so often a crack of thunder shakes the tunnel and blue energy flashes the tunnel with light.
