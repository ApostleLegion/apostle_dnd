[Surge District](Surge%20District%20Overview.md)

At the highest point of [Beacon](../Beacon%20Overview.md), a circular balcony can be found. Overlooking the entirety of the City State of Beacon, it is made entirely out of glass to let the viewers get the whole experience of the beauty of the technology the city has created.
