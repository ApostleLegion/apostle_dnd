# The Badlands
[The Infernal Lands](../Geography%20Overview.md)

The systems of tunnels, or the land not under the laws of one of the power cities, are known as the Badlands. You can find tunnels outside the cities and many travelers outpost along the way. Be careful, for the Badlands got their name reason.

A massive system of tunnels, caverns, ravines, mines, you name it, itâ€™s there, that connects the cities to one another. Patrols of guards from the nearby cities help keep some of the dangers away from the main routes to each city, but to travel these tunnels alone is a death sentence.
