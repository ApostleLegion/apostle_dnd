# Kettle Outpost
[Tunnel System](Tunnel%20System%20Overview.md)

The pitter patter of dripping water softly echoes in a small section of the tunnel in between Beacon and Ember. The source of these sounds is a nondescript hole in the wall. The wealthy and the well-informed know that this humble entrance leads to an exquisite retreat: a hot spring and matching inn.

After a short, downward walk through the hole in the wall, one would reach a small cavern. On one side is a slide lit by a string of electric lights that leads down and down. Next to it is a neat stack of sleds with a sign saying, "For your convenience." On the other side of the cavern is a bronze, cylindrical elevator with two buttons to go up and down.

After going down the spout of the aptly named Kettle Outpost, one would arrive in the belly of the Kettle. The source of the pitter-patter becomes obvious. The steam rising from the multitudes of hot springs condenses on the many stalactites and drips down onto the stone ground and the sloped, tiled roofs of the outpost. Sometimes, this rain falls down as snow.

Any visitors would be greeted by a member of one of the Yuan-Ti Pureblood families living here. There's no need to worry about bringing an umbrella because they will readily be provided.

There are plenty of hot springs to rent with varying amounts of privacy, ranging from large, shared baths to smaller, soundproofed private baths.
