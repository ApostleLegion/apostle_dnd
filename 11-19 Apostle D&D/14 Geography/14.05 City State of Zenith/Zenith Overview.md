# The City State of Zenith
The city of Zenith is known for is architecture in that the city is built from the ceiling of a massive cavern deeper in the tunnels of Apostle. The city is home to many of the races that are able to fly, but for those that cant fly there are massive rope bridges that span the length of the city connecting plaza and building alike. 

Zenith is a magical city being placed above large lake, the sight of its blue and silver roofed homes makes many think the reflection of the city is the true city itself. An air of fairytale and amazement is palpable throughout the township.
