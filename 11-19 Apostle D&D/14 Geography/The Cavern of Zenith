## The Cavern of Zenith 

The city of Zenith is known for is architecture in that the city is built from the ceiling of a massive cavern deeper in the tunnels of the Infernal Lands. The city is home to many of the races that are able to fly, but for those that can’t fly there are massive rope bridges that span the length of the city connecting plaza and building alike. 

Zenith is a magical city being placed above large lake, the sight of its green and silver roofed homes makes many think the reflection of the city is the true city itself. An air of fairytale and amazement is palpable throughout the township.
Below the depths of the lake a second portion of the city lies. A beautiful underwater city scape full of aquatic life and energy.

NOTE: The only way to get to Zenith is to travel through Beacon. If you aren't in Beacon before traveling, you'll have to pay the gp to travel to Beacon first, and then pay to get to Zenith

The travel through the newly opened tunnel in Beacon does go through a large hole in some copper alloy that is around a foot thick, many call this the “Dome” and not much is known about its construction or why it’s there.
