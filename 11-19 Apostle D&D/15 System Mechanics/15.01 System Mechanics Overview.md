# System Mechanics Overview
Articles contained under the System Mechanics folder talk about server-specific systems and tweaks to existing systems for things like:
- Traveling between cities
- Resting
- Player vs. Player combat

Downtime mechanic articles are included in their own [Downtime section](../13%20Downtime/13.01%20Downtime%20Overview.md).
