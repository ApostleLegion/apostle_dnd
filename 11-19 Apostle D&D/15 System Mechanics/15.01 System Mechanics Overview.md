## Why These Systems?
These mechanics are in place to induce role play, fun, and interesting ideas to flourish. These mechanics are a bit overwhelming to look at and see all the tracking that needs to be done, but this system will be fun and interesting in the long run. Questions and criticism about this system are very much appreciated. If there are questions, please contact Legion or Gracie in the Apostle Server with those questions, or write suggestions in the #suggestion-and-ideas channel on the Apostle Server.
