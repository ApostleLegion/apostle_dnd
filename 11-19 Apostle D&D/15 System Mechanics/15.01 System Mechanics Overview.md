# System Mechanics Overview
Articles contained under the System Mechanics folder talk about server-specific systems and tweaks to existing systems for things like:
- [How Time Works in Apostle](./15.02%20Time%20in%20Apostle)
- Resting
- Player vs. Player combat
- Traveling between cities

Downtime mechanic articles are included in their own [Downtime section](15.02%20Time%20in%20Apostle.md).

## Why These Systems?
These mechanics are in place to induce role play, fun, and interesting ideas to flourish. These mechanics are a bit overwhelming to look at and see all the tracking that needs to be done, but this system will be fun and interesting in the long run. Questions and criticism about this system are very much appreciated. If there are questions, please contact Legion or Gracie in the Apostle Server with those questions, or write suggestions in the #suggestion-and-ideas channel on the Apostle Server.
