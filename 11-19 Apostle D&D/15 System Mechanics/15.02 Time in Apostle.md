# Time in Apostle
> **IMPORTANT:** *Everything done in-character will be canon. All resources used in Role Play or anywhere else within the server will not come back until rested or the resource-specified time.
Take this into account when Role Playing and thinking about Quests.*
	
As this world is underground, we use a role play time system called **Bell Tolls**. 
- The Bell Toll System is to keep track of time in a day
- Each Bell Toll will be 4 hours (half a work day for most people of the Infernal Lands)
- 6 Bell Tolls equate to a full day

We will not be keeping track of the time or date of the world out of character, so role play and quests may happen whenever the DM and players wish to within the world.
