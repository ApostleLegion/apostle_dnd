# Player vs. Player Combat
As this is a game with combat, players may attack each other. When player-versus-player combat breaks out, ping a `@DM` and start the fight. Everything done in character will happen, so killing a player character is possible. If this does happen, the kill must be legal (no cheating) and have a role-play reason to do so. If the role-play reason to kill the player is insufficient for a DM to okay the outcome, the DM may retcon the combat how they see fit. Any retaliation out of character due to player-versus-player combat is forbidden and will be punished accordingly. Try not to PvP, but these guidelines will be followed if it does happen.
