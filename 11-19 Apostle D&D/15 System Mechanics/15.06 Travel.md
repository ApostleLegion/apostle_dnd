# Travel
[System Mechanics Overview](15.01%20System%20Mechanics%20Overview.md)

Travel is a free downtime action that can be taken as many times as a player wishes to travel. While traveling, a player will make these checks: `Survival`, `Perception`, and `Stealth or Intimidation`. 
- With three successes, the rate of complication drops to 0%
- With only two successes, the rate of complication rises to 10%
- With one success, the complication rate rises to 25%
- With zero success complication rate rises to 75% 

The DC to pass raises as players level up by the tiers of play in the PHB. This will be as follows:

Tier | DC
:--: | :--:
Tier 1 (levels 1-4) | DC 12
Tier 2 (levels 5-10) | DC 14
Tier 3 (levels 11-16) | DC 16
Tier 4 (levels 17-20 | DC 18

Complications are up to the DM running the travel. Most usual complications are when an enemy attacks the player, but on an off chance, a DM can rule that the player finds something interesting. 

Do not make it a habit to have complications be "good" things, as the tunnels are supposed to be scary to travel alone through. If a group of players wishes to travel through the tunnels, take the average level and average out the rolls made.
