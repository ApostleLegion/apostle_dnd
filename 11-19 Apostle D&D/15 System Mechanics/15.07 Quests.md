# Quests
[System Mechanics Overview](15.01%20System%20Mechanics%20Overview.md)

Quests can be short, long, asynchronous or synchronous, depending on the DM running it. For transparency, you can see how the rewards are calculated below.

## Combat Experience
The sum (Σ) of CR experience (CRxp) of creatures vanquished times 0.01 times the number of creatures killed of that CR (#C) rounded down equals combat experience given out to players for that quest. This is mathematically expressed below:


`Σ (CRxp*0.01*#C) = CXp`

> *Note:* Experience is not divided by # of characters present.

## Roleplay Experience
The number of objectives completed (O#) times the average party level (Pavg) times the constant experience value for the average party level tier of play (ToPC) rounded down equals role play experience at a **minimum of one experience**. This is mathematically expressed below:

`#O(Pavg*ToPC) = RXp`


## Total Experience
Add RXp and CXp together to get TXp for the quest.

We will use the Tiers of Play to calculate Experience points through a constant. When calculating the average party level, always round down to a whole number to find what tier the party is in, then use the appropriate constant. That constant will be as follows:

Tiers of Play (Levels) | Experience Constant (Per Objective) | Coin Multiple (for Quests)
:--: | :--: | :--:
1-4 | 0.25 | 10
5-10 | 0.5 | 100
11-16 | 0.75 | 1000
17-20 | 1 | 10000

## Material and Coin Rewards
To find the silver given out for a quest (not including individual looting) take the party average. Then use the tiers of play table above to determine the multiple that is necessary for the dice rolled. Take the number of players on the quest, subtract one from said number and roll that many d6’s. Then finally multiply the number rolled by the Coin Multiple found above to get the total silver to give out in a quest. For individual looting please use the Dungeon Master’s Guide tables on page 136, as a guideline.
