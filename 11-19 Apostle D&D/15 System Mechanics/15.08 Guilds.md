# Guilds
Guilds are a major part of the West March experience we would like to offer in Apostle. The system we will be using to dicate guild creation and opperation will be a first iteration, meaning there will be hiccups in its conception. An overview of the system will be below:
- Naming and Start up: Guilds all need a name to go by when people ask about them, so keep the name SFW and appropriate please! To start a guild a group or single player must gather enough Guild Backings from the [Carousing](https://github.com/ApostleLegion/apostle_dnd/blob/main/11-19%20Apostle%20D%26D/13%20Downtime/13.03%20Homebrew%20Downtime%20Rules.md#carousing-downtime-changes) table to gain enough report with the officials of a city they wish to set as their guild city. Once the player(s) have done so they may formaly create a guild, in which they must decide what type of guild they wish to persue. There are four types of Guilds that may be made and each have their own unique benifits. As the guild levels up it can choose different categories to fill in order to fully incapsulate the idea of the guild a player wishes to make. Once this is completed a Guild Bank will be allocated to store funds in that the guild recieves and or pays.
- Special Guild Downtime: A new guild may create a "Special Guild Downtime" that is specific to the guilds reason for creation. A couple of examples are a increased Bounty Hunt for a Monster Hunters Guild, or a special crafting session that creates an item that may be useful. This special downtime will be created when the guild is created and the DM and Guild Master will talk about the actual mechanical benefits then as well.
- NPC Recruitment: A new [Downtime](link of Recruitment Downtime) will be created for the guild. This downtime will take one of the two a guild member has for the week, but allows guild members to recruit NPCs to their guild to further level their guild and increase income for the guild itself. These NPCs will have a loyalty to the guild. Having a higher loyalty score will allow the NPC to do other things.
- Training NPCs: Once an NPC is recruited a player may train them to do a specific task within the guilds category, allowing that NPC to now take on Guild NPC Downtimes that can bring in gold for the guild or have consquences depending on the success or failure of the Guild NPC Downtime.
- Leveling Up NPCs: Once an NPC does a certain ammount of Guild NPC Downtimes they will gain the ability to level up using the [sidekick](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#sidekicks_tce) levels as a baseline. To level an NPC up they must have the ability to level up (meeting the specified downtime requirements), the Guild Master must use a "Level Up" token, and 25 gold pieces per side kick level already on the NPC. Doing this increases the chances that the NPC will be able to suceed on its downtimes. 
- Leveling Up the Guild: The guild has a level based upon a renown system and how many NPCs it has under its influence. Though a guild can only lose levels if 2 weeks pass of not meeting the requirments to stay the original level. 
- Guild Expenses: The guild will cost a large some of guild, but over time will become a very lucrative business. Each week the Guild Master will allocate resources to the NPCs it wishes to send on Guild NPC Downtimes. These downtimes have a chance of failing causing harm to the renown of the guild and the loss of revenue. In addition to this the guild master will roll dice dependant on how many Guild Downtimes were ran that week (player Guild Downtimes) and will also gain a number of gold depending on that roll. At the end of the week a DM will oversee the calculations necessary for revenue vs expenses of the week and give out gold to the Guild Bank accordingly.
