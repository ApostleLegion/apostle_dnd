- Coin Rewards: are linked to Party Average Level (Pavg) and the Challenge Rating (CR) of the enemies that the players fought. In order to get the total gold use the `!hoard <Pavg>` command and divide the given gold by **2**. Then for each of the enemies **looted** use the `!treasure <CR>` command for how many enemies were looted. Once all of these coin values are computed add the two `Hoard Coin/2` and `Treasure Coin * # of enemies looted` together and split the coin evenly among the players.
- Gems and Art: The `!hoard <Pavg>` command also has the ability to roll Gems and Art Pieces which will now be refered to as "Quest Goods". These quest goods will be given out equaly unless the total ammout rolled is less than the party number of players. In that case add up coin value of the quest goods and add it to the Coin Rewards above. In the case that an over abundance of items are rolled, the extra ammount of quest goods will be converted to coin and given as additional coin to the players like Coin Reward. Otherwise, each player should get the same ammount of quest goods from the same quest.
- Recipes: The `!hoard <Pavg>` command also has a chance to roll magic items and potions. In this case, any item rolled is given out to players of the quest as a recipe in which they can [Craft](https://github.com/ApostleLegion/apostle_dnd/blob/DM-main/11-19%20Apostle%20D&D/13%20Downtime/13.03%20Homebrew%20Downtime%20Rules.md#crafting) the item they would recieve. If the item has options, the DM is responsible to decide which option the item will use. Duplicate recipes are not possible, so if a recipe is rolled twice only a single recipe is given out.
