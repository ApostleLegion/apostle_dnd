# Crafting
Crafting is one of the many downtime actions that a player can take. In which we will use the downtime rules as mentioned in Xanatharâ€™s, but instead of work weeks there is a DC and necessary completion checks. The cost for the item will be distributed between the downtime sessions necessary to complete the item, stated below. The DCs will be stated below as well as the necessary completed checks:
	Common: DC 10, One Completion, 50gp per downtime session
	Uncommon: DC 15, Two Completions, 100gp per downtime session
	Rare: DC 20, Four Completions, 500gp per downtime session
	Very Rare: DC 25, Six Completions, 3500gp per downtime session
	Legendary: DC 30, Eight Completions, 12500gp per downtime session
Any session costs must be paid before the rolls are made to craft an item. If a player fails the check to make an item, they must pay half the gold of the downtime session of crafting for the item on top of the session cost. If they fail the check by 10 or more, they must pay the downtime session cost again and lose the material necessary to make the item. 
The materials that are necessary for crafting are material shards. These shards come in different rarities from uncommon to legendary. To craft an item, a player needs a number of shards of a rarity similar to the item they wish to craft. A shard will be consumed if the downtime crafting session is successful or if the player fails by 10 or more.

All downtime rulings are up to the DMs guiding players through them. These are guidelines for DMs use and are subject to change.
