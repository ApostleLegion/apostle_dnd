 # Downtime Rules
 We use a modified version of [Zanathar's Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte)'s downtime. 
 
 ## Modifications
 Activities that are changed will be noted below.
 - In our system all rewards and prices are dropped a coin value. (Gold -> Silver) 
 - The major change from the downtime of Zanathar's to Apostle's downtime is the Carousing activity. 
 - We have also created the bounty hunting activity and travel activity that will be outlined below.

## Carousing Downtime Changes:
*Note:* This section doesn't really talk about the changes of the Carousing Downtime but focuses more on the role of NPCs
The most major change is the use of NPCs to further other downtime activities. 

- Every NPC that was gained under a carousing subcategory (i.e. Crime, Working, etc.) can be used to double rewards for any activity other than Carousing. 
- NPCs can also bail characters out of bad situations but also “uses” that NPC. 

### Special Carousing Roll Scenarios
- If on the Carousing Activity and the character rolls above a 21+ on the check:
  - please roll a d100 and anything above a 75 makes one of the three NPCs gained, a 3x NPC instead of a 2x
- If a player rolls a natural 20 the DM can either:
  - give them one 3x NPC plus the other two 2x NPCs or 
  - give them an “in” to something for later development. 
  
  All Carousing must be noted in [#carousing-channel](https://discord.com/channels/1003109601035690064/1048723906510463008) in the Staff Server.
